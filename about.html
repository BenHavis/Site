<section id="aboutsection">
<p>As a public adjuster, I work independently on behalf of the policyholder. 
Homeowners hire public adjusters to assist them through the process of filing an insurance claim and 
negotiating the settlement with their inurance company.</p>

<p>While many people believe that the adjuster their insurance company hires to handle your claim is on your side,
keep in mind they work for the insurance company, not you, and at the end of the day they are looking out for
their company, not the policyholder. You need someone who only looks out for you.</p>

<p>When hiring a public adjuster, you can be certain that you have someone on your side who can advocate on your
behalf in your claims process. Public adjusters usually take a percetnage of your claim as their fee, usually
around 10%. However, keep in mind that those who hire public adjusters get a much higher payout than those who don't.</p>

<p>Even with the fee, hiring a public adjuster will give you the peace of mind of having a professional on your side 
who fights for you and helps you get the settlement you deserve.</p>

<p>Submitting a claim and dealing with your insurance company can get very complicated. As a public adjuster,
I specialize in understanding and evaluating homeowners insurance policies, as well as filing and handling
all types of property claims.</p>
